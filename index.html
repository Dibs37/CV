            I am the Founder and CEO of <strong>ToothFairy</strong> Gaming Studios. My company focuses on developing different genre of games on multiple
            platforms including Mobile Devices and Computers. The current project includes a mobile device based RPG game. I am also 
            currently a PhD student at ASU. My Research focuses on the fairness of Machine Learning and AI. The current model I am 
            studying is Probabilistic Circuits which focuses on creating a <em><strong>reliable</strong></em> and <em><strong>
            efficient</strong></em> probabilistic model in Linear Time. I am also a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the SCAI Department 
            at ASU. During the Fall 2022 semester, I taught <em><strong>"C++ Programming"</strong> and <strong>"Computer Organization 
            and Design"</strong></em>.
